<p><strong>Opening Prayer</strong> - Micheal Williams<br><strong>Opening Remarks</strong>- Edris Sesay<br><strong>Financial report</strong> - Micheal Williams <br>The total amount wasnâ€™t accurate - attendees were not sure about the numbers Micheal needed to calculate and post the financial report again.<br><br>The by-laws were reviewed again by the rest of the committee for approval. A meeting is scheduled for <strong>10/16/22.  </strong>to vote the by-laws into law. Printed copies will be made for each member attending the meeting for final review before voting and passing them into law.<br><br>Registration and contribution- the numbers are not encouraging so far, Prezzo and the entire executive committee encourage members to continue to pay their monthly contribution for us to push the community ahead. Please reach out if you have any questions or concerns.<br>Thank you all</p>
